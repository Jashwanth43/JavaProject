##Java Projects

Over the years, I've accumulated extensive hands-on experience in Java development, both through my professional career and personal learning journey. At Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Peopleâ€™s Tech Group (PTG), I've been deeply involved in full-stack Java development, significantly enhancing my expertise in Java frameworks, microservices, and cloud technologies.

Additionally, I've built numerous Java projects by learning from resources like Ineuron and various YouTube tutorials. These projects are neatly organized into folders, each containing multiple practical examples to illustrate key Java concepts and best practices clearly and concisely.

My goal is to share these projects publicly, one by one, through GitHub and LinkedIn. Each project is carefully designed to simplify complex Java concepts, offering practical, interview-focused examples that enable swift learning and efficient revision.

Through these repositories, I aim to create an accessible resource beneficial to fellow developers, making interview preparation and Java learning easier, faster, and more effective.

I'm always available to connect and open to exploring new opportunities. Let's grow together and make learning Java a simpler, more rewarding experience!
